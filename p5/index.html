        <p>
            NewJeans (Korean: 뉴진스; RR: Nyujinseu), also known as NJZ (엔제이지; Enjeiji), is a South Korean girl group
            formed by ADOR, a
            subsidiary of Hybe Corporation. The group consists of five members: Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, and
            Hyein. The group
            pre-released their debut single "Attention" on July 22, 2022, ahead of their debut extended play, which was
            released on
            August 1, 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name NewJeans has two meanings. It alludes to the idea that jeans are a timeless garment and the group's
            desire to carve out a timeless image for themselves. It is also a play on the phrase "new gen," and refers
            to the
            group ushering in a new generation of pop music. In February 2025, the members changed their name to "NJZ"
            amidst their contract dispute with Hybe. Following
            a court ruling regarding the dispute, the group discontinued the use of "NJZ" in April.

        <h4>2019–2021: Formation and pre-debut activities</h4>
        <p>
            NewJeans is a girl group project that began preparations in early 2019 as a collaboration between Big Hit
            Entertainment
            and Source Music, led by Min Hee-jin, who had just joined as Chief Executive Officer. Global auditions were
            held from
            2019 to early 2020. In late 2021, the project was transferred to the new label ADOR after Min Hee-jin became
            CEO.
            Further auditions were held until early 2022, and the final lineup was finalized in March 2022. The group,
            once dubbed
            "Min Hee-jin's Girl Group," was originally scheduled to debut in 2021 but was delayed due to the COVID-19
            pandemic.
            Before their debut, some members were already active in the entertainment industry: Danielle appeared on the
            variety
            show Rainbow Kindergarten (2011), Hyein debuted in the children's group U.SSO Girl (2017) and later joined
            Play With Me
            Club until 2021, while Hanni and Minji appeared as cameos in BTS's "Permission to Dance" music video (2021).

        <h4>2022–2023: Introduction, Debut and Get Up</h4>
        <p>
            NewJeans was officially launched in July 2022 through a surprise strategy, starting with the unpromoted
            release of the
            music video for "Attention," which immediately captured public attention. They then released the singles
            "Hype Boy" and
            "Hurt," followed by their debut mini-album, which surpassed one million physical sales and became the
            best-selling debut
            album by a female K-pop artist in South Korea. Despite controversy over the lyrics of "Cookie," the group
            still earned
            numerous rookie awards and debuted on various music programs. In late 2022, they achieved further success
            with "Ditto"
            and "OMG," which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and solidified their international reputation.
            Throughout 2023, NewJeans further solidified their global status through major collaborations with Coca-Cola
            and the
            release of their second mini-album, *Get Up*, which sold over 1.6 million copies in its first week. The
            singles "Super
            Shy," "ETA," and "Cool With You" were highly successful, reaching number one on various Korean charts and
            performing
            strongly internationally. They have also performed on global festival stages like Lollapalooza and are
            scheduled to
            perform at Summer Sonic, making NewJeans one of the fastest-growing and most influential K-pop girl groups
            of their
            generation.

        <h4>2024–present: Japanese debut, upcoming album and conflict with Hybe</h4>
        <p>
            Starting in April 2024, a major conflict arose between NewJeans, Min Hee-jin, and Hybe following Min's
            dismissal as ADOR
            CEO. NewJeans members publicly defended Min and revealed allegations of harassment, discrimination, content
            deletion,
            and personal data leaks by management. They issued an ultimatum to Hybe to reinstate Min, which was
            rejected. Tensions
            escalated when Hanni testified at the National Assembly alleging unfair treatment, and NewJeans sent ADOR a
            notice of
            contract termination. Despite winning several awards, their on-stage statements sparked rumors of
            disbandment. In
            November 2024, Min resigned from ADOR, while NewJeans stated they wanted to leave the agency and retain the
            group's
            name—a claim ADOR denied and sparked a legal dispute.
        </p>
        <p>
            As 2025 entered, the conflict became more complex. Industry bodies like KMF criticized NewJeans' actions,
            while media
            outlets like Dispatch accused Min of orchestrating the conflict—allegations the group denied and countered
            with a
            defamation lawsuit. The five members then opened personal Instagram accounts, faced new legal restrictions
            from ADOR,
            and in February 2025 introduced the new group name NJZ. They performed at ComplexCon Hong Kong before being
            ordered to
            cease all independent activities. After releasing their new song, "Pit Stop," the group announced an
            indefinite hiatus
            while they continued to appeal the court ruling in favor of ADOR.
